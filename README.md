# Arthur R. C. McCray

I’m a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford working on **machine learning for computational imaging and inverse problems** in electron microscopy (4DSTEM, ptychography, Lorentz TEM).  
My main interestas the moment include **self-supervised learning**, **deep priors**, physics-informed reconstruction, and open-source scientific software.

## Focus areas
- ML for inverse problems in (S)TEM: reconstruction, phase retrieval, robust and quantitative analysis on real-world data  
- Computational imaging: ptychography, 4D-STEM workflows  
- Scientific Python + PyTorch; reproducible research software and tooling  
- Magnetic materials / spin textures / vdW ferromagnets 

## Core projects
### quantEM — Quantitative Electron Microscopy (core developer)
[Repo](https://github.com/electronmicroscopy/quantem) and [tutorials](https://github.com/electronmicroscopy/quantem-tutorials)
- Core developer for ML modules in a growing EM analysis toolkit
- Developed **ML-enabled iterative ptychography** methods and code
- Contributed to core infrastructure (data structures, visualization, utilities, configuration backend)
- Wrote tutorials and examples to help new users adopt the toolkit

### PyLorentz — Lorentz TEM simulation & analysis (lead developer/maintainer)
[Repo](https://github.com/PyLorentz/PyLorentz)
- Sole author and maintainer of a widely adopted Python codebase for **Lorentz TEM (LTEM)** simulation and analysis
- Used by the LTEM community for simulation-assisted interpretation and quantitative analysis of magnetic textures
